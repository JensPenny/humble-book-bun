Get The Adventurer’s Almanac today!</p><p>Author’s Note: It can be argued that time is both our greatest gift and worst enemy. The passage of the seasons not only—hopefully—brings us wisdom, but reminds us that our span of days is finite. This is true for both ourselves as gamers and for our imaginary counterparts who dwell in the fantastic lands of the campaign world. Nevertheless, despite the importance of time, it is something often overlooked in roleplaying campaigns, aside from the calculations of how long a spell will last or the length of a journey from one adventuring locale to another. At their very worst, fantasy campaigns become static places were nothing outside the adventurers’ scope ever seems to occur.</p><p>The Adventurers’ Almanac attempts to correct this oversight by presenting the game master with not only a wondrous calendar useable in most fantasy games, but by also providing him or her with an entire year’s worth of adventure seeds, new monsters, unique magic items, interesting NPCs, and momentous occasions. With this book as part of your gaming library, you have access to a simple, yet evocative, way to count the days and a go-to source for adventure ideas when your imagination needs a kick-start.</p><p>Written in the similar vein of The Dungeon Alphabet, The Adventurers’ Almanac is not a hard and fast “this is how things should be done” gaming supplement, but a spring-board for your own creativity. With a little mental elbow grease, it’s possible to turn the hundreds of adventure ideas waiting inside its pages into full-blown, epic campaigns that will keep your players entertained and waiting to see what happens next.</p><p>Suitable for any fantasy roleplaying game, The Adventurers’ Almanac is the perfect resource for any game master lacking in that most precious of commodities—Time, itself. So make you sure your dues are paid to the “Order of Adventurers, Explorers, and Treasure-Seekers,” stop by your local chapterhouse for your copy of The Adventurers’ Almanac, and get ready for a year of unforgettable adventure!</p><p>Reviews:</p><p>Twenty Side to Every Story: “This book is a perfect resource for both last-minute game prep as well as long-term planning for an entire campaign.”</p><p>Writer: Michael Curtis</p><p>Cover Art: William McAusland</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Adventurers%20Almanac%20(System%20Neutral","rating_average":null,"rating_count":null,"review_count":null,"created":"2025-06-05T21:02:30+00:00","developers":"Michael Curtis"},

Learn what to expect during an arrest and interrogation, and how to stay out of prison, avoid falling for tricks, and how not to rat out your friends.  Harold H Thompson’s parents immigrated from Ireland to West Virginia in the early 20th century. Politicized at a young age in a coal mining town, Thompson was discharged from the Vietnam war after being wounded,  discovering anarchism. Returning to the U.S., Harold began a campaign of expropriating wealth and clashed with law enforcement. In 1978, Douglas Crawley killed the mother of Thompson’s oldest son. Crawley served as a police informant and was soon released from prison. Thompson found Crawley drinking in a bar and shot him dead. Imprisoned in 1979, Thompson served as a jailhouse lawyer, filing grievances, petitions, appeals, and lawsuits against prison officials whenever warranted. Thompson attempted escape in 1986 and was tried for attempted murder of three police officers. He died in West Tennessee State Penitentiary of a heart attack in 2008 at the age of 66. His anarchist friends scattered his ashes in Northern Ireland. A friend described Harold’s crimes as “no worse than the wage slavery that underpins our economy.”  Harold created this pamphlet because it saddened him to hear stories about activists, environmentalists, and anarchists being arrested and put through the judicial mill. He believes that with these tools others can avoid his fate of life behind bars.</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61794979-anarchist-survival-guide-for-understanding-gestapo-interrogation-mind-ga?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=tkB4GWV68b&amp;rank=1","rating_average":5,"rating_count":2,"review_count":null,"created":"2025-04-28T19:29:47+00:00","developers":"Thompson, Harold H"},

A rarity in that he was an African American serial killer, his murderous rampage spurred controversy throughout the city.

However, something even worse lurked in their midst. To all who knew him, Robert Hansen was a typical hardworking businessman, husband, and father. But hidden beneath the veneer of mild respectability was a monster whose depraved appetites could not be sated. From 1971 to 1983, Hansen was a human predator, stalking women on the edges of Anchorage society—women whose disappearances would cause scant outcry, but whose gruesome fates would shock the nation. After his arrest, Hansen confessed to seventeen brutal murders, though authorities suspect there were more than thirty victims. Alaska State Trooper Walter Gilmour and writer Leland E. Hale tell the story of Hansen’s twisted depredations—from the dark urges that drove his madness to the women who died at his hand and finally to the authorities who captured and convicted the killer who came to be known as the “Butcher Baker.”</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13130783-the-boys-volume-10?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=h9IXUFU1m9&amp;rank=1","rating_average":4.12,"rating_count":3542,"review_count":176,"created":"2025-06-21T21:02:17+00:00","developers":"Gilmour/Hale"},

The standard vampire that we know as the common variety is far removed from this first cause, but it still thrives on the same negative energy. Vampires have a natural sensitivity to places where negative energy pools, and this is why they are often found at the center of wars, revolutions, and corruption.</p><p>But there is more to this story. Unbeknownst to all but the most erudite sages, vampires are a necessary byproduct of the natural order of things. The process that forms a vampire spawn from a creature slain by a vampire actually sucks ambient negative energy out of the prime material plane, concentrating it in the undead life force of the newly revived spawn. Vampires act as living conduits of negative energy, channeling it into themselves through their own actions, then feeding off it and destroying it in the process.</p><p>Thus, the deities that govern good and law allow vampires to exist. Their followers are sent to defeat the vampires, but the scales can never tip too far. By their very nature, vampires act as lightning rods for negative energy; as they feed off it, they reduce its concentration in the world, and they absorb the foul byproducts of human conflict that would otherwise attract far greater evils.</p><p>A few vampires gain true insight into their natural position in the world. These arch-vampires do not accept that the gods should “allow” vampires to exist. The most powerful arch-vampires become demi-gods and travel to the outer planes, where they direct armies of minions and sponsor other arch-vampires.</p><p>For generations, the old gods regarded the arch-vampire demi-gods as a natural correction mechanism, much like wolves who feed on overpopulated deer. But now the wolves seek to become king. The vampire armies are becoming more active, and the forces of good have stepped up their efforts against them. For the first time, the scales are tipping toward the vampires’ favor.</p><p>The Complete Guide to Vampires takes you into this world of bloodlust and power in an exploration of the greatest monster of all time.

In the pages of The Cottage Garden, you'll first draw inspiration from the stories and landscapes of generations of famous cottage gardeners, including Gertrude Jekyll, Vita Sackville-West, William Robinson, Margery Fish, and Tasha Tudor. Then, meet modern cottage gardeners from around the globe who combine billowing masses of flowers such as poppies, delphinium, lupines, foxgloves, peonies, roses, lilies, and many more to create dreamy landscapes infused with the romance and wildness of cottage-style gardening. You'll find no formal lines, rigid rules, or perfect spacing in the cottage garden. Instead, the form is organic and purposefully unstructured. Plants self-sow here and there, bulbs pop up and spread unrestricted, and everything appears casual; though as you'll come to learn through Dalby's words, it is all done with great intent. Overflowing with textures and colors, the cottage gardens featured throughout this book in hundreds of full-color photographs are found in places as diverse as Germany, Sweden, Denmark, England, and the United States. The accompanying text is derived from Dalby's personal visits to these gardens, along with his intimate interviews with the resident gardeners. Dalby provides useful details about the design, development, and continued evolution of cottage gardens. He shares the stories of these breathtaking modern cottage gardens in a way that allows you to glean inspiration you can use to create a cottage garden of your own, whether large or small.  The gardens profiled in these pages exhibit the essential foundational elements and principals of well-designed cottage gardens. Whether home is in the countryside or a suburban subdivision, the profiled gardens will serve as both muse and motivation for the creation of a classic backyard cottage garden in your own space.

On their backs they bore a legendary treasure-hoard: coffers spilling over with blazing gems, strongboxes bright with gold, and the jeweled idols of a thousand gods. They were never seen again.</p><p>Today the gleaming domes at the top of the world have fallen to the passage of time and the crush of glaciers. Once-imperious halls are coated with dust and ice; memories of the fabled treasure hoard - and the heretical Theophages - are lost to antiquity.</p><p>But deep within the heart of the mountain, the flames of Chaos sputter and flare.</p><p>Now the legacy of the God Eaters is drawing to a close. With each thunderous turn of the Alembic Key, meteors streak the sky and prophets fling themselves from the turrets of high towers. In the alleys and the palaces, all know that the hour of the dragon will soon be at hand. Can you and your companions master the mysteries of the God Eaters in time? Or - like so many others before - will you succumb to the Music of the Spheres?</p><p>The boxed set is bursting with the puzzles, foes, and magic only found in a DCC RPG adventure. Inside you will find the God Eaters' grand alchymical experiment, with its spinning alembic and rotating elemental spheres. This takes the form of a large game board, approximately 17\"\" x 22\"\", with four separate spinning maps that attach to the board. An adventure booklet of 112 pages provides hitherto unknown monsters, perils, and traps. These lurk in the forgotten corridors, certain to bring a quick end to overconfident explorers.</p><p>Players will have the opportunity to study and manipulate the fabled Alembic Key, a relic rife with Theophagic sigils and zodiac signs. But beware, foolhardy reavers! Rotating the key spins the dungeon, transforming the PCs and altering reality itself! Left in the hands of a fidgety player, it could easily spell the end of the multiverse. This physical prop is composed of two spinning dials and is used by players during the adventure.</p><p>And as befitting DCC #100, the adventure is replete with player handouts in the form of a 28-page booklet containing over 40 illustrations of the Alembic, its elemental spheres, and the terrors lurking within the dark halls, as well as the infamous Sheaves of Chaos.</p><p>Finally, any adventure is only as good as the judge running it. Music of the Spheres is Chaos was designed with the judge in mind. The boxed set includes the Bookmark of 4 Parts - a tool for referencing the PCs' own changes.</p><p>This Boxed Set includes:</p><p>- Adventure Booklet (112 pages)</p><p>- Player Handout Booklet (28 pages and more than 40 illustrations)</p><p>- Large 17\" x 22\" Gameboard and four separate Spinning Maps</p><p>- Double-sided bookmark of 4 Parts (to track changes imposed by the Spinning Map)</p><p>- Alembic Key prop (used by players to spin the dungeon!)</p><p>- 3 Sheaves of Chaos handouts</p><p>With its many unique components, Music of the Spheres is Chaos captures all the magic and wonder that you've come to expect from a DCC RPG adventure. But fans familiar with Harley Stroh's work in Legacy of the Savage Kings, Sailors on the Starless Sea, and his many other adventures will know that our adventures are always far more than the sum of their parts.</p><p>You won't mistake this dungeon for any other adventure, anywhere, ever.</p><p>Be sure to check out our complete coverage of DCC #100 The Music of the Spheres is Chaos on www.goodman-games.com! From videos to liveplays to deep dives to Harley Stroh's own design diaries, there is a wealth of information about this innovative adventure!

These blackguards were defeated after a great battle and their grim fortress, the Iron Tower, was razed. A small abbey was established near the ruins, where generations of monks mixed ancient eldritch wards, mighty clockwork traps, and multiple failsafes to build the Iron Crypt of the Heretics.

In the shadowy, pine-grown valleys of the Deep Hollows lurk mysteries of a bygone age and a new evil emerging from the ruins of the past. The adventurers must plumb the mountains' secluded reaches to root out this rising terror before its power comes to fruition. Standing in their path are cackling witches, subtle devils, lingering spirits, and a foul thing that moves in the night. Can the heroes appease that which lies within the Chained Coffin and thwart the dawn of a new and terrible age?</p><p>DCC #83: The Chained Coffin was originally released way back in 2014. The boxed set proved immensely popular, and not just for the spinning map puzzle. The Appalachian-style fantasy setting of The Shudder Mountains, inspired by the works of Appendix N author Manly Wade Wellman, provides a unique place for your characters to adventure. Michael Curtis did a wonderful job of bringing The Shudder Mountains alive, and several supplemental volumes were published.</p><p>Now we are offering a compilation of all of the material from the original DCC #83: The Chained Coffin boxed set, including all the stretch goal booklets, as well as much, much more:</p><p>- All content from DCC #83.1: Tales of the Shudder Mountains and DCC #83.2: Death Among the Pines</p><p>- The Shudder Mountain material published in several Gen Con Program Guides</p><p>- Moon Eyes and Fire-Flies, a new adventure set in the Shudder Mountains</p><p>- Buzzard Hollow, a new Shudder Mountains mini-setting</p><p>- Ma Bigginty's Book of Backwoods Wisdom, a collection of inspiring material that will bring The Shudder Mountains to life in your game</p><p>The Spinning Wheel Puzzle! This adventure includes a number of supernatural locations. The entrance to one is blocked by a supernatural door. This door comprises a special spinning wheel puzzle that forms a central puzzle in the adventure: beyond the ancient bridge is a 40' wide, 30' deep ledge that lies perpendicular to a sheer rock face. Set into the rocky cliff at the far side of the ledge stands a great stone archway sealed by an imposing door. Blue bolts of lightning ripple silently across the door's face, hinting at magical wards or seals. In the center of the door are three circular dials set one inside the next. Each dial bears several different symbols, no two of which repeat.</p><p>Rules Set: DCC RPG</p><p>Writer: Michael Curtis</p><p>Cover Art: Ken Kelly</p><p>Cartography: Doug Kovacs</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61481909-dungeon-crawl-classics-83?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=onAN5xHPg6&amp;rank=1","rating_average":5,"rating_count":1,"review_count":null,"created":"2025-03-22T22:09:20+00:00","developers":"Michael Curtis"},

The year is 2112, and it’s the apocalypse exactly as expected: rivers receding, oceans rising, civilization crumbling. Humanity has given up hope, except for a group of Indigenous outcasts who have discovered a time travel portal in a cave in the desert and figured out where everything took a turn for the worst: America. Convinced that the only way to save the world is to rewrite its past, they send one of their own—a reluctant linguist named Tad—on a bloody, one-way mission to 1492 to kill Christopher Columbus before he reaches the so-called New World. But there are steep costs to disrupting the timeline, and taking down an icon isn’t an easy task for an academic with no tactical training and only a wavering moral compass to guide him. As the horror of the task ahead unfolds and Tad’s commitment is tested, his actions could trigger a devastating new fate for his friends and the future. Join Stephen Graham Jones and artist Davide Gianfelice for Earthdivers, Vol. 1, the beginning of an unforgettable ongoing sci-fi slasher spanning centuries of America’s Colonial past to explore the staggering forces of history and the individual choices we make to survive it.</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83823063-earthdivers-vol-1?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=cjYyzYh0m0&amp;rank=1","rating_average":3.62,"rating_count":1310,"review_count":259,"created":"2025-06-12T21:01:42+00:00","developers":"Stephen Graham Jones"},

When Martin and Tawny’s children disappeared, the couple barreled into the desert to track them down at any cost. Instead, they ran afoul of another group of rovers who claimed to be saving the world by traveling through a cave portal to the year 1492 to prevent the creation of America—an idea that defied belief until the grieving parents were lured into the cave and vanished in time and space. Now alone, Tawny must adapt to the wild marshlands of prehistoric Florida, circa 20,000 BC, and the breathtaking and bloodthirsty megafauna are the least of her problems when she’s caught in a war between a community of native Paleo-Indians and an occupying Solutrean force. Tawny’s odds of survival are in free fall, but she’s a mother on a mission…and she’s holding on to hope that the cave brought her here for a family reunion.

Organizations began to see the real value of information and information technology in the mid-1980s. Forty years later, it’s time to leverage your ECRM program and cybersecurity strategy in the same way. The main topics covered include the case for action with specific coverage on the topic of cybersecurity as a value creator, including how the courts, legislators, and regulators are raising the bar for C-suite executives and board members. The book covers how the board’s three primary responsibilities (talent management, strategy, and risk management) intersect with their ECRM responsibilities.ECRM was once solely focused on managing the downside of risk by defending the organization from adversarial, accidental, structural, and environmental threat sources. Author BobChaput presents the view that we must focus equally on managing the upside of cyber strengths to increase customer trust and brand loyalty, improving social responsibility, driving revenue growth, lowering the cost of capital, attracting higher quality investments, creating competitive advantage, attracting and retaining talent, and facilitating M&amp;A work. He focuses on the C-suite and board role in the first part and provides guidance on their roles and responsibilities, the most important decision about ECRM they must facilitate, and how to think differently about ECRM funding. You will learn how to the pivot from cost-center thinking to value-center thinking.Having built the case for action, in the second part, the book details the steps that organizations must take to develop and document their ECRM program and cybersecurity strategy. The book first covers how ECRM must be integrated into business strategy. The remainder of that part presents a sample table of contents for an ECRM Program and Cybersecurity Strategy document and works through each section to facilitate development of your own program and strategy. With all the content and ideas presented, you will be able to establish, implement, and mature your program and strategy.  What You Will LearnRead new information and treat ECRM and cybersecurity as a value creatorReceive updates on legal cases, legislative actions, and regulations that are raising the stakes for organizations, their C-suites, and boardsThink differently about funding ECRM and cybersecurity initiativesUnderstand the most critical ECRM decision that boards must facilitate in their organizationsUse practical, tangible, actionable content to develop and document your ECRM program and cybersecurity strategy “This book should be mandatory reading for C-suite executives and board members. It shows you how to move from viewingcybersecurity as a risk to avoid, and a cost center that does not add value and is overhead, to seeing cybersecurity as an enabler and part of your core strategy to transform your business and earn customer and stakeholder trust.” —Paul Connelly, First CISO at the White House and HCA Healthcare  Who This Book Is For The primary audience includes Chief Information Security Officers, Chief Risk Officers, and Chief Compliance Officers.

Indeed, the total number of the Wests’ victims may never be known.A case reminiscent of the “Moors Murders” committed in the 1960s in Manchester by Myra Hindley and Ian Brady—as if Hindley and Brady had married and kept on killing for decades—Fred &amp; Rose “is a story of obsessive love as well as obsessive murder” (The Times, London).</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/849573.Fred_Rose?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=UFSZ6D87KT&amp;rank=1","rating_average":4.04,"rating_count":3750,"review_count":259,"created":"2025-06-21T21:02:17+00:00","developers":"Sounes, Howard"},

From Here to There presents nine all-new adventures focused on traveling from point A to point B. Sure, your players may be going from one dungeon to another - but why not spice up things in between? From aerial assaults to haunted bridges, From Here to There turns \"getting there\" into a lot more fun! Covering levels 2 to 13, this compilation has a place in every campaign.</p><p>This adventure compilation includes the following great adventures:</p><p>- The Quick and the Dead (level 12), by Aeryn Rudel: While en route to their next adventure, the PCs pass through a thick copse of trees and are ambushed by a group of quickling muggers. The quicklings, however, do not attack to kill; instead, the little fey attempt to snatch a valuable item from each PC and then race off into the forest!</p><p>- When Madness Seeps Through (level 5), by Philippe-Antoine \"\"ChattyDM\"\" Menard: While traveling from a nearby town to their destination, the PCs spot a group of aberrant humanoids running across the road, each clutching struggling humans who call for help. Chasing the humanoids or following their trail deeper in the forest, the PCs find a forgotten temple occupied by the corrupted remnants of cultists.</p><p>- The Deadly Blue Yonder (level 13), by Brandes Stoddard: A group of evil cultists discovered a nest of wyvern eggs, and when those eggs hatched the cultists trained the wyverns as mounts. They have used this remarkable advantage to establish a dominion over the local countryside. As the PCs pass through their territory, they must defend themselves against aerial attack!</p><p>- The Toll Station (level 6), by Adrian Pommier: While passing through a toll station, the PCs are beset by nightmare creatures pulled from the imprisoned minds of the road wardens. To awaken the sleeping guardsmen and end the attacks, the PCs must smash a profane idol and defeat a demon of the Nightmare Goddess!</p><p>- The Crossing (level 4), by Chris Dias: The PCs are traveling near a river or through mountainous terrain when they find themselves in a thick fog. As they venture further, they come to a bridge. With no sign of alternate routes, they must make their way across. The bridge is an illusion generated by a predatory monster called a chosis mimic - a psychic creature that feeds on the life spirit of those traveling near it. The illusionary bridge has no beginning and no end, and no matter how long the PCs travel, they never reach its end before they reach theirs - unless they destroy the chosis mimic!</p><p>- The Hanging Tree (level 5), by Lee Hammock: The village of Tarrow has been using a local hanging tree to execute criminals for centuries, but now an innocent man has been added to its roster of the dead. The spirits of those previously killed on the tree have now risen up in a quest for vengeance, making travel through the area very difficult. After escaping from the undead raised by the hanging tree, the players reach Tarrow and discover why the spirits of the tree are restless by talking to the locals.</p><p>- Flying High (level 2), by Colleen Simpson: The PCs are en route to their next adventure, traveling through a lightly wooded hilly area, when they are swooped upon by steelwing hippogriffs, which attempt to carry one or more PCs to their nest site. When the PCs arrive at the nest area, they observe kobolds attacking the steelwing hippogriff nests. The steelwing hippogriffs need the assistance of the heroes!</p><p>- Mystery at the Wandering Wineskin Inn (level 5), by Ken McCutchen: The adventurers are resting comfortably at an inn. When the sun rises on a new day, the characters discover that one of the party members is missing! There are several items out of place in the room, and a search reveals several interesting clues. To locate the missing character, the party must gain knowledge about the missing companion, overcome misdirection from false allies, and defeat the brigands who are holding the missing character for ransom.</p><p>- The Hunting Party (level 2), by Brandes Stoddard: In the wilds, the PCs encounter a large group of goblins. The normally aggressive creatures recognize that the PCs carry their weapons with experience and skill, and they are reluctant to engage a foe who could cost them many of their own hunters and foragers. They even go so far as to buy off the PCs with a side of boar meat or venison from a recent kill.</p><p>Rules Set: 4E</p><p>Developer: Harley Stroh</p><p>Writers: Chris Dias, Lee Hammock, Phillippe-Antoine Menard, Ken McCutcheon, Adrian Pommier, Aeryn Rudel, Colleen Simpson, Brandes Stoddard, Harley Stroh</p><p>Cover Artist: David Griffith</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42972032-the-map-from-here-to-there?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=rlLj3MpJYU&amp;rank=1","rating_average":3.68,"rating_count":3265,"review_count":549,"created":"2025-03-22T22:09:20+00:00","developers":"Chris Dias, Lee Hammock, Phillippe-Antoine Menard, Ken McCutcheon, Adrian Pommier, Aeryn Rudel, Colleen Simpson, Brandes Stoddard, and Harley Stroh"},

Then it's time to say goodbye to your standard grass lawn and join the Groundcover Revolution!  Turns out you're not alone in your desire to ditch the lawn and replace it with something prettier, more diverse, lower maintenance, welcoming to pollinators, and good for Earth's climate health. Reducing the lawn is among the biggest trends in homeownership, with an endless stream of homeowners looking for an eco-friendly alternative to a traditional turfgrass lawn. In the last few years alone, over 23 million American adults converted part of their lawn to a natural landscape, and now they're looking to do even more.  The biggest challenge to adopting this new ideal of the perfect lawn? Knowing how and when to replace your turf, and which plants are the best ones for the job. Groundcover Revolution is here with all the answers you need (and some you didn't even know you needed!).  Those answers include: • How replacing a lawn with groundcovers reduces resource consumption on a significant level • Why groundcovers require far less long-term maintenance than turf after establishment • The many additional benefits of groundcovers, including erosion control, a reduction in chemical usage, a boost in biodiversity, and mitigation of climate change as a carbon sink • The ways groundcovers overcome challenges such as tree roots, compacted soils, poor drainage, and dense shade • The step-by-step mechanics of how to get rid of your lawn, how to place and plant groundcovers from seeds, plugs, or transplants, and how to care for your new \"quilted lawn\" once it's in place   Also included are 40 in-depth profiles of plants that are perfect choices for replacing a grass lawn. There are options for sun, for shade, for dry and wet sites, and for various climates around the globe. There are choices that bloom, options that are evergreen, and selections that are deer resistant. Author Kathy Jentz has also included an incredibly useful chart that gives youall the specifics on each of the 40 choices for quick reference and to make your groundcover selection process even easier.  Don't let a lack of information stop you from creating the no-mow groundcover lawn of your dreams. Join the revolution and say goodbye to the burden of lawn care and hello to summer weekends relaxing by the pool or camping with family and friends. Whether you want to replace the entire lawn or just reduce the amount of land dedicated to turf, it's time to usher in a new and improved idea of what a beautiful lawn should be.</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61360110-groundcover-revolution?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=pFYTCiSoAp&amp;rank=1","rating_average":3.85,"rating_count":52,"review_count":23,"created":"2025-04-04T20:46:45+00:00","developers":"Kathy Jentz"},

That's the battle cry of millions of modern gardeners who are not only looking to reduce the amount of time and energy they have to spend tending a lawn, but they're also looking to improve the lives of their family, friends, and neighbors by supplying them with fresh, homegrown food. In the United States alone, 46 million acres of land are covered in turfgrass (that's more acreage than corn and soybeans combined!). Imagine all the good that would come if that land were dedicated to growing food instead! Converting unused areas of the landscape into food gardens helps mitigate the effects of climate change, reduces food miles, improves food security, and allows us to be a better steward of our little slice of the planet. But how do you get started? Which plants do you choose? Is there a series of best practices to follow to successfully convert your yard into an edible oasis so that it's not just high-yielding, but it's also attractive? Growing an Edible Landscape is here to help answer all of these questions and many more.Setting up an edible landscape is much more than just placing a few tomato-filled raised beds in the middle of the lawn, though for some gardeners, this might be a logical place to start. The eventual goal, however, is to have a landscape filled with layers of fruitful plants combined together to produce edible harvests for as many months of the year as possible. To reach that end, there's much to plan and do to ensure your success. Authors Gary Pilarchik of @therustedgarden and Dr. Chiara D'Amore have devised the perfect guidebook to take you from \"turfgrass overwhelm\" to consistent harvests of a huge diversity of homegrown edible plants.

From raspberries and asparagus to fruit trees and dandelions, these food plants are great additions to any edible landscape plan. Start small or go big—it's your choice!

On January 7, 1994, residents of Berkshire Hills woke up to a typical winter day in the majestic woods of Western Massachusetts. But as that fateful day unfolded, three separate crimes—each unsettling in its own way—would converge in this quaint corner of New England. That day, a trial began for college student, Wayne Lo, who celebrated his 18th birthday by purchasing an assault rifle and opening fire on campus—killing two and wounding four others. Elsewhere, two young girls were accosted in the changing room at the local pool. And another young girl narrowly escaped being abducted at gunpoint on her way to school. Her quick thinking later resulted in profound repercussions regarding another case—that of a young boy who vanished from a strip mall. Though these events appeared unrelated, it seemed as though the world had suddenly gone mad. In Hidden Demons, Margery B. Metzger details these events and reveals a savage serial killer, Lewis Lent, Jr., who lurked in the shadows. It was the bravery of a father and daughter, and the remarkable work of law enforcement officers, that would see justice done.</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42380537-lucifer-and-the-hidden-demons?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=Zz0GS9ghiG&amp;rank=1","rating_average":4.63,"rating_count":159,"review_count":18,"created":"2025-06-21T21:02:17+00:00","developers":"Metzger, Margery B"},

As cyberattacks continue to increase in volume and sophistication, it’s not a matter of if, but when, your organization will have an incident. Threat actors target accounts, users, and their associated identities—whether human or machine, to initiate or progress their attack. Detecting and defending against these malicious activities should be the basis of all modern cybersecurity initiatives. This book details the risks associated with poor identity security hygiene, the techniques that external and internal threat actors leverage, and the operational best practices that organizations should adopt to protect against identity theft, account compromises, and to develop an effective identity and access security strategy. As a solution to these challenges, Identity Security has emerged as a cornerstone of modern Identity and Access Management (IAM) initiatives. Managing accounts, credentials, roles, entitlements, certifications, and attestation reporting for all identities is now a security and regulatory compliance requirement.  In this book, you will discover how inadequate identity and privileged access controls can be exploited to compromise accounts and credentials within an organization. You will understand the modern identity threat landscape and learn how role-based identity assignments, entitlements, and auditing strategies can be used to mitigate the threats across an organization’s entire Identity Fabric.  What You Will Learn Understand the concepts behind an identity and how its associated credentials and accounts can be leveraged as an attack vector Implement an effective identity security strategy to manage identities and accounts based on roles and entitlements, including the most sensitive privileged accounts Know the role that identity security controls play in the cyber kill chain and how privileges should be managed as a potential weak link Build upon industry standards and strategies such as Zero Trust to integrate key identity security technologies into a corporate ecosystem Plan for a successful  identity and access security deployment; create an implementation scope and measurable risk reduction; design auditing, discovery, and regulatory reporting; and develop oversight based on real-world strategies to prevent identity attack vectors  Who This Book Is For Management and implementers in IT operations, security, and auditing looking to understand and implement an Identity and Access Management (IAM) program and manage privileges in these environments</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48816267-identity-attack-vectors?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=BqEvSXidMX&amp;rank=1","rating_average":3.64,"rating_count":14,"review_count":1,"created":"2025-07-28T21:01:49+00:00","developers":"Morey J.

Sometimes situations arise where powerful emotions must be repressed. Displaying anger at a powerful lady can be dangerous; openly lusting after the ladyís consort could prove deadly. With most people, repression of emotions can lead to stress or even illness ó mental, physical, or both. With some, however, those emotions run deep and hold great power. How does the repressed emotion of a powerful sorcerer manifest itself? What of a young person with the undeveloped potential to be a summoner? Or what if a relatively normal person just dams up a reservoir of repressed emotion, only to have a triggering incident ignite it into life like a tindertwig tossed in a vat of lamp oil? In rare cases, these powerful emotions manifest, arising from a person to take on a life of their own. These are the ikiryo, the living spirits. Guided by the subconscious desires of its progenitor, an ikiryo acts where the person does not, free of its creatorís inhibitions, morals, and reservations. This powerful emotional force is a danger to all it encounters, especially the focus or cause of those emotions, and potentially deadly to those with which it interacts.</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Lost%20Lore%20Ikiryo%20The%20Living%20Spirits%20(PF)","rating_average":null,"rating_count":null,"review_count":null,"created":"2025-03-22T22:04:48+00:00","developers":""},

In New Naturalism, horticulturist and modern plantsman Kelly D. Norris shares his inspiring, ecologically sound vision for home gardens created with stylish yet naturalistic plantings that mimic the wild spaces we covet—far from the contrived, formal, high-maintenance plantings of the past. Through a basic introduction to plant biology and ecology, you'll learn how to design and grow a lush, thriving home garden by harnessing the power of plant layers and palettes defined by nature, not humans.The next generation of home landscapes don't consist of plants in a row, pruned to perfection and reliant on pesticides, fertilizers, and herbicides to survive. Instead, today's stunning landscapes convey nature's inherent beauty. These gardens are imbued with romance and emotion, yet they have so much more to offer than their gorgeous aesthetics. Naturalistic garden designs, such as those featured in this groundbreaking new book, contribute to positive environmental change by increasing biodiversity, providing a refuge for wildlife, and reconnecting humans to nature. In the pages of New Naturalism you'll find: •Planting recipes for building meadows, prairies, and other grassland-inspired open plantings even in compact, urban settings•Nature-inspired ways to upgrade existing foundation plantings, shrub beds, and flower borders to a wilder aesthetic while still managing the space•Inspiration for taking sidewalk and driveway plantings and turning them into visually soft, welcoming spaces for humans and wildlife alike•Ideas for turning shady landscapes into canopied retreats that celebrate nature •Creative ways to make an ecologically vibrant garden in even the smallest of spacesNew Naturalism approaches the planting beds around our homes as ecological systems. If properly designed and planted, these areas can support positive environmental change, increase plant and animal diversity, and create a more resilient space that's less reliant on artificial inputs. And they do it all while looking beautiful and improving property values.</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53398957-new-naturalism?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=AJA0TCjbJZ&amp;rank=1","rating_average":3.94,"rating_count":179,"review_count":37,"created":"2025-04-04T20:46:45+00:00","developers":"Kelly D.

There was no pattern to the murders, no common thread other than the fact that the victims were all vacationers, robbed of their possessions and slain in seemingly random crimes. Authorities across three continents and a dozen nations had no idea they were all looking for same man: Charles Sobhraj, aka “The Serpent.” A handsome Frenchman of Vietnamese and Indian origin, Sobhraj targeted backpackers on the “hippie trail” between Europe and South Asia. A master of deception, he used his powerful intellect and considerable sex appeal to lure naïve travelers into a life of crime. When they threatened to turn on him, Sobhraj murdered his acolytes in cold blood. Between late 1975 and early 1976, a dozen corpses were found everywhere from the boulevards of Paris to the slopes of the Himalayas to the back alleys of Bangkok and Hong Kong. Some police experts believe the true number of Sobhraj’s victims may be more than twice that amount.

It began as a home invasion by the “Manson family” in the early hours of August 9, 1969. It ended in a killing spree that left seven people dead: actress Sharon Tate, writer Voyteck Frykowski, coffee heiress Abigail Folger, hair stylist Jay Sebring, student Steven Parent, and supermarket owner Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary. The shock waves of these crimes still reverberate today. They have also, over time, eclipsed the life of their most famous victim—a Dallas, Texas, beauty queen with Hollywood aspirations. After more than a dozen small film and television roles, Tate gained international fame with the screen adaptation of Jacqueline Susann’s Valley of the Dolls, but The Fearless Vampire Killers marked a personal turning point, as she would marry its star and director, Roman Polanski. Tate now had a new dream: to raise a family—and she was only weeks away from giving birth the night Charles Manson’s followers murdered her. Drawn from a wealth of rare material including detective reports, parole transcripts, Manson’s correspondence, and revealing new interviews with Tate’s friends and costars as well as surviving relatives of the murder victims, Sharon Tate and the Manson Murders gives readers a vital new perspective on one of the most notorious massacres of the twentieth century. The dark legacy of the cult phenomenon is still being explored in novels (Emma Cline’s The Girls) and TV shows (NBC’s Aquarius). In addition to providing the first full-fledged biography of Sharon Tate, author Greg King finally gives a voice to the families of the slain, notably Tate’s mother, Doris. Her advocacy for victims’ rights was recognized during President George H. W. Bush’s 1992 “A Thousand Points of Light” ceremony. This is the true story of a star who is being rediscovered by a new generation of fans, a woman who achieved in death the fame she yearned for in life.</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/870431.Sharon_Tate_and_the_Manson_Murders?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=Dlx6skCHZz&amp;rank=1","rating_average":4.05,"rating_count":822,"review_count":77,"created":"2025-06-21T21:02:17+00:00","developers":"King, Greg"},

One morning in July 1974, Anita Andrews, the owner and bartender at Fagiani’s Cocktail Lounge in Napa, California, was found dead in her bar—raped, beaten, and stabbed to death in a bloody frenzy. Meanwhile a month after Anita’s murder, young Michele Wallace, was driving down a road in the mountains near Crested Butte, Colorado, when she gave two stranded motorists, including a man named Roy, a ride. She was never seen alive again. Fourteen years later, Charlotte Sauerwin, engaged to be married, met a smooth-talking man at a Laundromat in Livingston Parish, Louisiana. The next evening, her body was found in the woods; she’d been raped, tortured, and her throat slashed. The three murders would remain unsolved, eating at the hearts, minds and lives of the women’s families, friends and communities. Then in the early 1990s, a rookie Gunnison County sheriff’s investigator named Kathy Young began looking into the Wallace case and identified a suspect named Roy Melanson, a serial rapist from Texas. It would lead her and other investigators looking into murders and rapes in other states to a serial killer who struck again and again with seeming impunity. Smooth Talker is the story of Melanson, his depredations, and the intrepid police work that went into bringing him to justice not just in Colorado, but California and Louisiana. “Steve Jackson is one of the greats in the true crime author world.”—C.L.

Following decades of rising income instability and falling savings—not to mention the twin economic upheavals of the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic—they have become the new normal. Rather than treat “Tightropers” as victims or blame them for their financial decisions, Teetering lets them tell their own stories of setbacks, sacrifice, and perseverance, and provides original research into their unique pressures and needs. Tightropers deserve support at all stages of their lives to build savings for both daily emergencies and long-term retirement. Teetering shows how legislators and regulators can make a difference without unintended consequences and how financial technology innovation can help Tightropers manage their money in uncertain times. Teetering makes the case for urgent action by financial institutions, investors, regulators, policymakers, employers, and influencers to recognize and address the financial forces that have pushed the American dream out of reach for so many. It proposes common ground solutions that work regardless of political leaning and provides a roadmap for how innovators can serve this growing need and how banks and others can start saying “yes” to their customers again.</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33951701-teetering-on-disaster?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=ap0MtV8ZM8&amp;rank=1","rating_average":4.08,"rating_count":52,"review_count":36,"created":"2025-07-05T21:01:28+00:00","developers":""},

In 1997, the bodies of young African American men began turning up in the cane fields of the quiet suburbs of New Orleans. The victims—many of them transient street hustlers—had been brutally raped and strangled, but police had no leads on the killer’s identity. The murders continued, leaving southeast Louisiana’s gay community rattled and authorities desperate for a break in the case. Then, Detectives Dennis Thornton and Dawn Bergeron came together as task force partners, indefatigable in their decade-long effort to track down the killer. In 2006, DNA evidence finally linked the murders to a suspect: the unassuming Ronald Joseph Dominique, who had lived under the radar for years, working as a pizza deliveryman and meter reader. But who was Ronald Dominique and what led him to commit such heinous crimes? With direct access to the investigation, Dominique’s confession, and all of the killer’s body dump sites in throughout the state, author Fred Rosen enters the warped mind of a murderer and captures a troubled, disturbing, and broken life. As with the many other serial killers he has covered, including Jeffrey Dahmer (the Milwaukee Cannibal) and Dennis Rader (the BTK Killer), Rosen provides a horrifying and fascinating account of the lengths to which a bloodthirsty monster will go to lure and brutalize his victims.</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32600097-the-bayou-strangler?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=C5ZsFmVFDz&amp;rank=1","rating_average":3.57,"rating_count":371,"review_count":43,"created":"2025-06-21T21:02:17+00:00","developers":"Rosen, Fred"},

The Cybersecurity Trinity will provide cybersecurity professionals with the necessary background to improve their defenses by harnessing the combined power of these three concepts. The book is divided into four sections, one addressing each underlying concept and the final section discussing integrating them to harness their full potential. With the expected growth of AI and machine learning (ML), cybersecurity professionals must understand its core concepts to defend AI and ML-based systems. Also, most cybersecurity tools now incorporate AI and ML. However, many cybersecurity professionals lack a fundamental understanding of AI and ML. The book's first section aims to demystify AI and ML for cybersecurity practitioners by exploring how AI and ML systems work, where they are vulnerable, and how to defend them. Next, we turn our attention to security automation. Human-centered cyber defense processes cannot keep pace with the threats targeting organizations. Security automation can help defenders drastically increase the speed of detection and response. This section will discuss core use cases that security teams can implement, including intelligence processing, incident triage, detection, and response. This section will end with strategies for a successful security automation implementation and strategies that can lead to failure. Accelerating the defense is but one side of the equation. Defenders can also implement ACD methods to disrupt and slow the attacker. Of course, ACD spans a broad spectrum, including some that could raise legal and ethical concerns. This section will explore some ACD methods and discuss their applicability, as well as the need to include business, legal, and ethical considerations when implementing them. Security teams often treat AI, automation, and ACD as disparate solutions, addressing specific problems. However, there is much overlap, and security teams must develop a cohesive approach to realize the full potential. The last section combines these three concepts to form a comprehensive strategy. The resulting strategy will have AI as the foundation, incorporating automation to speed up defense and ACD to disrupt the attacker.   What You Will Learn:  Understand the many uses of AI and ML and the concepts underpinning these technologies. Learn how to protect AI and ML systems by recognizing the vulnerabilities throughout their lifecycle. Integrate AI and ML-based systems to enhance cybersecurity. Develop security automation processes to enhance situation awareness, speed the time to respond, and increase the bandwidth of the limited security operations staff. Develop an ACD strategy to slow the attackers while minimizing legal and ethical concerns. Design a comprehensive strategy with AI as the foundation, incorporating automation to speed up defense and ACD to disrupt the attacker.    Who This Book is for: The primary audience is cybersecurity professionals looking to improve their organization's security posture by leveraging AI and ML-based security tools and combining them into a comprehensive strategy incorporating automation and ACD. This target audience will have a cybersecurity background and an interest in AI and ML.

Run these adventures (in any order) as a mini-campaign, or ignore the frame story and use them as standalone adventures.","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18741355-the-devil-s-spine?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=IYZf2zdvBr&amp;rank=1","rating_average":3.78,"rating_count":41,"review_count":3,"created":"2025-06-28T21:02:37+00:00","developers":"Monte Cook"},

Most roll tables, however, help GMs determine specific things, but with a minimum of contextual information, such as size (Small, Medium, Large, etc.), a minimum of descriptive “color” such as items in a treasure hoard (4 gems worth 50 gp each; a +1 dagger; a wand of magic missiles), or a minimum of helpful information such as types of government (oligarchy; federalism; theocracy).<br><br>In the moment, these snap results are helpful. But once put into play, they end up causing GMs even more work because once you’ve determined the local government is a federalism, for example, you have to know what a federalism is and how it functions, which requires time and research. Similarly, when rolling on a table to determine the predominant architectural style of a city’s buildings, a result of “Ionic Order” provides no help when the GM is actually called upon to describe what, exactly, that looks like.<br><br>The Game Master’s Book of Astonishing Random Tables solves these problems and more by providing hundreds of tables for nearly every worldbuilding and gameplay situation. Need to know what the local food is like? Roll for it. Need to know how the city’s plumbing is organized or if they have a sewer system? Roll for it. Need to know what specific pathology drives the mad draconian warlord just beyond the city’s gates? Roll for it. Want to determine what a sorcerer’s spell effects look like or what unique way they cast their spells? You know the answer!<br><br>When warranted, many of the table results are “enhanced” with supplemental information, such as in the local government or architecture examples noted above. Other tables will have a branching element, providing a path to fleshing out larger scale subjects that require more detail than can be provided with a single table.<br><br>The book will also include three one-shot adventures that help GMs put the book’s tables into play right away, so that they can see exactly how helpful and enhancing they can be. They’ll also learn that filling in the unexpected details of an adventure with random roll results can change the nature of the adventure each time it’s played. When encountering a simple beggar, for example, the entire direction of the adventure may change if that poor soul has knowledge of a temple’s secret underground vault, which the players are trying to break into. It’ll change the encounter even more if that information is wrong.</span></p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75417675-the-game-master-s-book-of-astonishing-random-tables?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=CoMabBTQo9&amp;rank=1","rating_average":4.56,"rating_count":54,"review_count":7,"created":"2025-05-31T21:00:58+00:00","developers":"Ben Egloff"},

Whether it’s rescuing the little dog that was kidnapped by the local troll, stopping an assassination attempt at the archduke’s wedding or recruiting an army to disrupt the construction of a world-ending ritual site, the party will always find a way to save the day.

This is the story of their case.Among the numerous suspects author and attorney Christian Barth identifies are infamous serial killers Ted Bundy and Gerald Eugene Stano, who were living within an hour’s drive from the murder scene. The killers also resided next to one another on Florida’s Death Row, and indirectly confessed to the double homicide.A culmination of more than nine years of research, Barth’s book is compiled from multiple sources, including interviews with retired New Jersey State Police detectives, law enforcement officials from other jurisdictions, federal agents, possible witnesses, victim family members, as well as information gathered from FBI case files, letters, journals, libraries, newspaper articles, and university archives.In scintillating detail, Barth presents the case, including previously undisclosed information surrounding these brutal murders, as well as an examination of recent technological advancements in crime scene analysis and FBI serial killer profiling that could help identify the killer.

For weeks that fall, the body count of sexually violated, brutally murdered young women escalated. With increasing alarm, Los Angeles newspapers headlined the deeds of a serial killer they named the Hillside Strangler. The city was held hostage by fear. But not until January 1979, more than a year later, would the mysterious disappearance of two university students near Seattle lead police to the arrest of a security guard—the handsome, charming, fast-talking Kenny Bianchi—and the discovery that the strangler was not one man but two. Compellingly, O’Brien explores the symbiotic relationship between Bianchi and his cousin Angelo Buono, their lust for women as insatiable as their hate, before examining the crimes they remorselessly perpetrated and the lives of the unsuspecting victims they claimed. Equally riveting is O’Brien’s account of the trial—one of the longest and most controversial criminal court cases in American history—with the defense team parading, one after another, expert witnesses who had been effectively duped by Bianchi’s impersonation of a man suffering multiple personality disorder. It’s one way a man might contrive to get away with murder.

Beginning in 1968 and continuing into the 1970s, a predator stalked California and New York, torturing, raping and murdering young girls and women. But who was the monster behind these tragedies? Eventually, a suspect emerged, but he didn’t look like a monster. Indeed, Rodney Alcala was a handsome, charming photographer who’d once studied film at New York University under director Roman Polanski. With his wit and easy self-confidence and humor, he’d even been selected as the “winner” on the popular television show “The Dating Game.” But his real game was much more sinister. In 2010, Alcala was convicted of murdering five women in California during the 1970s; then in 2013, as he waited on Death Row, he confessed to the murder of two more in New York. Yet, that might not be the end of the nightmare he caused. At his arrest, police found his “portfolio” with thousands of nude and erotic photographs of women and boys, who may also be among his victims. In The Killing Game, bestselling true crime author and radio show host, Alan R. Warren reveals the shocking details of Alcala’s brutal crimes, as well as the trials and appeals that stretched on for decades and may still not be over.</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78131.The_Killing_Game?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=KWTO1qNEWS&amp;rank=1","rating_average":4.2,"rating_count":31542,"review_count":665,"created":"2025-06-21T21:02:17+00:00","developers":"Warren, Alan R"},

In 1967, during the time of peace, free love, and hitchhiking, nineteen-year-old Mary Terese Fleszar was last seen alive walking home to her apartment in Ypsilanti, Michigan. One month later, her naked body—stabbed over thirty times and missing both feet and a forearm—was discovered, partially buried, on an abandoned farm. A year later, the body of twenty-year-old Joan Schell was found, similarly violated. Southeastern Michigan was terrorized by something it had never experienced before: a serial killer. Over the next two years, five more bodies were uncovered around Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti, Michigan. All the victims were tortured and mutilated. All were female students. After multiple failed investigations, a chance sighting finally led to a suspect. On the surface, John Norman Collins was an all-American boy—a fraternity member studying elementary education at Eastern Michigan University. But Collins wasn’t all that he seemed. His female friends described him as aggressive and short tempered. And in August 1970, Collins, the “Ypsilanti Ripper,” was arrested, found guilty, and sentenced to life in prison without chance of parole.

This is not to say that innovation is lacking, as new technologies, services, and solutions (as well as buzzwords) are emerging every day. This book will be the first cybersecurity text aimed at encouraging abstract and intellectual exploration of cybersecurity from the philosophical and speculative perspective. Technological innovation is certainly necessary, as it furthers the purveying of goods and services for cybersecurity producers in addition to securing the attack surface of cybersecurity consumers where able.  The issue is that the industry, sector, and even academia are largely technologically focused. There is not enough work done to further the trade—the craft of cybersecurity. This book frames the cause of this and other issues, and what can be done about them. Potential methods and directions are outlined regarding how the industry can evolve to embrace theoretical cybersecurity innovation as it pertains to the art, as much as to the science.  To do this, a taxonomy of the cybersecurity body of work is laid out to identify how the influences of the industry’s past and present constrain future innovation. Then, cost-benefit analysis and right-sizing of cybersecurity roles and responsibilities—as well as defensible experimentation concepts—are presented as the foundation for moving beyond some of those constraining factors that limit theoretical cybersecurity innovation. Lastly, examples and case studies demonstrate future-oriented topics for cybersecurity theorization such as game theory, infinite-minded methodologies, and strategic cybersecurity implementations. What you’ll learn  The current state of the cybersecurity sector and how it constrains theoretical innovation How to understand attacker and defender cost benefit The detect, prevent, and accept paradigm How to build your own cybersecurity box Supporting cybersecurity innovation through defensible experimentation How to implement strategic cybersecurity Infinite vs finite game play in cybersecurity  Who This Book Is For This book is for both practitioners of cybersecurity and those who are required to, or choose to, employ such services, technology, or capabilities.</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61863728-theoretical-cybersecurity?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=wJLTdKynED&amp;rank=1","rating_average":5,"rating_count":1,"review_count":null,"created":"2025-07-28T21:01:49+00:00","developers":"Jacob G.

By the time he was brought to trial in 1992, Soviet serial killer Andrei Chikatilo had killed more than fifty women and children, often sexually abusing them and leaving their bodies mutilated beyond recognition. Although he was initially arrested in 1984, the police lacked enough evidence to pin the unsolved murders on him and he was able to torture and kill dozens more before his eventual conviction. Compiling exclusive interviews and trial transcripts, journalist and editor at London’s Sunday Times Peter Conradi reveals how the grandfather and former teacher carried out a horrific twelve-year killing spree right under the nose of authority. Based on extensive research into Chikatilo’s past and the elements of Soviet society that allowed his crimes to go unsolved for so long, Conradi delves into the life of one of history’s most prolific and disturbing serial killers. Interviews with Moscow police detectives detail the fervent hunt for the man who preyed on young children, prostitutes, and runaways—a search that turned up many dead ends and false convictions before a massive undercover surveillance effort ultimately nabbed Chikatilo. A chilling look into the deranged mind of a monster, The Red Ripper is a comprehensive and shocking true crime account—plus photos—of one of the twentieth century’s deadliest killers and the manhunt to catch him.</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1437406.The_Red_Ripper?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=QikCU0VAyg&amp;rank=1","rating_average":3.88,"rating_count":636,"review_count":72,"created":"2025-06-21T21:02:17+00:00","developers":"Conradi, Peter"},

In the 1980s and 1990s, forty-nine women in the Seattle area were brutally murdered, their bodies dumped along the Green River and Pacific Highway South in Washington State. Despite an exhaustive investigation—even serial killer Ted Bundy was consulted to assist with psychological profiling—the sadistic killer continued to elude authorities for nearly twenty years. Then, in 2001, after mounting suspicion and with DNA evidence finally in hand, King County police charged a fifty-two-year-old truck painter, Gary Ridgway, with the murders.

In the mid-1980s, someone stabbed six women to death in the Connecticut River Valley on the border between New Hampshire and Vermont. The murderer remains at large and the total number of his victims is unknown. In this brilliant work of true crime reportage, New York Times–bestselling author Philip E. Ginsburg provides fascinating insights into the groundbreaking forensic methods used to track the killer and paints indelible portraits of the lives he cut so tragically short. The Shadow of Death re-creates the fear that consumed the idyllic region when young women began to disappear with horrifying regularity. Neighbors used to leaving their doors unlocked suddenly wondered who among them was a sadistic serial killer. Friends and family of the victims were left to endure the bottomless pain of imagining their loved ones’ terrifying last moments. Desperate to stop the slayings, local police and FBI investigators used exotic new techniques to try to unmask the murderer. In some of the book’s most harrowing sections, Ginsburg documents the extraordinary efforts of psychologist John Philpin as he risks his own emotional stability to get inside the mind of a madman. Law enforcement officials identified several suspects and came tantalizingly close to putting all the pieces of the puzzle together, but it was only after a pregnant woman survived a brutal attack that the killings appeared to stop.

But a few people—a very few people—have discovered how to travel to other places. They call them recursions, and they’re like limited pocket dimensions with their own laws of reality, connected to Earth via a dangerous, chaotic network they call the Strange. Recursions spawn from the myths, legends, and fiction of humanity, so the setting of virtually any story, film, or novel could form a recursion, as could any mythical realm. Most of the creatures in this realm aren't really self-aware, but a few understand that they aren’t alone in the Strange. Some of them know about Earth, and the limitless universe beyond it. And some of them are very, very dangerous. Travel to these realms for adventure or riches, or to save the Earth from the many dangers now leaking into our world from The Strange.

On the morning of April 27, 1908, the farmhand on a lonely property outside La Porte, Indiana, woke to the smell of smoke. He tried to rouse the lady of the house, the towering Belle Poulsdatter Sorenson Gunness, and he called the names of her three children—but they didn’t answer, and the farmhand barely escaped alive. The house burned to the foundation, and in the rubble, firemen found the corpses of Belle, her two daughters, and her son. The discovery raised two chilling questions: Who started the fire, and who cut off Belle’s head? As investigators searched the property, they uncovered something astonishing: The remains of a dozen or more men and children who had been murdered with poison or cleaver were buried beneath the hog pen. It turned out Belle Gunness was one of the most prolific serial killers in American history. And when the investigation revealed that the body found in the fire might not have been hers, the people of La Porte were forced to confront the terrifying realization that Belle might have gotten out alive. Nominated for an Edgar Award for best factual crime story, The Truth about Belle Gunness is based on extensive interviews with witnesses and residents of La Porte who knew Belle and her family. Perfect for fans of In Cold Blood or The Devil in the White City, it is a “magnificent [and] brilliantly written” exploration of a highly unusual murderer (The New York Times).</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35435433-the-truth-about-belle-gunness?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=gVZb9w76px&amp;rank=1","rating_average":3.36,"rating_count":300,"review_count":39,"created":"2025-06-21T21:02:17+00:00","developers":"de la Torre, Lillian"},

On March 11, 1944, police were called to investigate foul-smelling smoke pouring from the chimney of an elegant private house near the Arc de Triomphe. In the basement of 21 rue Le Sueur, they made the first of many gruesome discoveries: a human hand dangling from the open door of a coal-burning stove. Proceeding to the rear of the home, detectives found rib cages, skulls, and internal organs strewn across the floor and large piles of quicklime mixed with fragments of bone and flesh. The Gestapo had two offices in the neighborhood—were Hitler’s henchmen responsible for the carnage? Or was it the work of French Resistance fighters purging Paris of traitors and German spies? As the investigation unfolded, a more sinister possibility emerged. The building’s owner, Dr. Marcel Petiot, was a handsome and charismatic physician whose past was littered with bizarre behavior and criminal activity. When he was finally captured eight months later, Dr. Petiot claimed he was a loyal member of the Resistance who helped kill Nazi collaborators. Prosecutors charged that he was a sadistic mass murderer who lured at least twenty-seven innocent people to their deaths with promises of escape. Estimates of the actual number of his victims ran as high as 150 men, women, and children. From the first stages of the investigation to the sensational trial in which Dr. Petiot’s superior intelligence and perverse wit were on full display, author Thomas Maeder meticulously reconstructs one of the twentieth century’s most fascinating and lurid murder cases. Drawing on classified police files and interviews with surviving participants, The Unspeakable Crimes of Dr. Petiot is a riveting true crime saga that that “reads like a shocking psychological thriller” (Newsweek).</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30462664-the-unspeakable-crimes-of-dr-petiot?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=MzDFsk09YB&amp;rank=1","rating_average":3.42,"rating_count":65,"review_count":13,"created":"2025-06-21T21:02:17+00:00","developers":"Maeder, Thomas"},

Myra Hindley was convicted in 1966, with her boyfriend Ian Brady, of what became known as the Moors Murders. Between July 1963 and October 1965 the couple sexually assaulted and killed five children and teenagers. Four bodies were buried on the moors near Manchester, and a tape recording was played in court of one child begging Hindley for their life. Hindley became an icon of evil, but in 1973, in London&amp;rsquo;s Holloway prison, one woman fell in love with her. Hindley was a highly intelligent woman capable of charming anyone. Desperate to regain her freedom, she convinced an infatuated prison guard named Patricia Cairns, a former Carmelite nun, that she was a reformed woman who wanted to return to the Catholic church. Believing Hindley was sincere, yet had no chance of parole, Cairns plotted to break Hindley out of prison. This riveting story is told in vivid detail based on prison records and new interviews with former prison staff, inmates, and even the women&amp;rsquo;s accomplice. Interspersed with powerful accounts of the Moors Murders, This Woman reveals Hindley&amp;rsquo;s complex character and fiendish powers of manipulation&amp;mdash;skills she used to lure children to their deaths in the 1960s, and used again to try to escape from prison.&lt;/p&gt;</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/221289749-this-american-woman?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=ceyqXMESN4&amp;rank=1","rating_average":4.49,"rating_count":2038,"review_count":387,"created":"2025-06-21T21:02:17+00:00","developers":"Sounes, Howard"},

The underdark is far more than just dungeons and caves. It is a veritable underground continent, populated by advanced civilizations, ancient ruins, sunless seas, alien magic, bizarre creatures, and the horrid denizens of the gloom. The standards of the surface world hold no sway in the underdark, and its mysteries, ferocity, and danger will challenge even the hardiest of adventurers.</p><p>This book includes everything you need to create a compelling underdark world. Underdark adventures are easy to integrate with an existing campaign, as the very nature of the underdark lends itself to layering - simply arrange for the discovery of a subterranean portal, and the land beneath your existing campaign has a new life.</p><p>The Underdark Adventure Guide is divided into four chapters:</p><p>- The first chapter examines the characters of the underdark, especially among the most populous races: the drow, duergar, derro, svirfneblin, and troglodytes. This section defines the most renowned traits of these races with a variety of new prestige classes, then concludes with new equipment, feats, and skill applications useful to everyone. You can use this section to flesh out the enemies your PCs will face, or apply them to the stats for these underdark races found in the MM and DMG to use them as player characters.</p><p>- Chapter two introduces a variety of new monsters suitable to life in the underdark.</p><p>- Chapter three provides guidelines for creating an underdark campaign. These are mostly for inspiration - a collection of keywords and ideas that can help you get started on a new campaign, or tie together elements of an existing one.</p><p>- The book concludes with chapter four, which describes several points of interest in great detail. These cities, camps, and other locations can be dropped into your own campaign as needed, or inserted in their totality as an already-defined area.</p><p>The Underdark Adventure Guide is a stand-alone book. It can be used in conjunction with the Aerial Adventure Guide, or used independently.

These days we have the whole world at our fingertips, so shouldn’t happiness be just as readily available? As more people continue to retire, they are finding themselves in this strange stage of life that has never been better, but it doesn’t feel better. In spite of the fact that they may be doing well financially, in spite of modern technology, the internet, and greater total wealth than at any other time in history, happiness seems to be leveling off, if not declining. Wealthfulness is the balance of wealth and happiness, the combination of monetary success and meaningfulness. What financial endeavors are the wisest choices for us? How much time should we be spending investing, saving, and planning? How much money do we need to be truly happy in life? The answers to these questions are highly personal, and Lance Alston helps us find each one, and plan accordingly by taking into account our individual personalities and circumstances. “While most financial planners bury their clients in graphs, numbers and fin-tech gibberish, Lance Alston has provided readers with an easily understood map of what a Buddhist might call ‘Right Money.’”—Scott Burns, nationally syndicated financial columnist “Lance Alston takes a bold step with Wealthfulness, pitting research and data against the prevailing bad behavior of Wall Street.
