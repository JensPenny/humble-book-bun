In the pages of The Cottage Garden, you'll first draw inspiration from the stories and landscapes of generations of famous cottage gardeners, including Gertrude Jekyll, Vita Sackville-West, William Robinson, Margery Fish, and Tasha Tudor. Then, meet modern cottage gardeners from around the globe who combine billowing masses of flowers such as poppies, delphinium, lupines, foxgloves, peonies, roses, lilies, and many more to create dreamy landscapes infused with the romance and wildness of cottage-style gardening. You'll find no formal lines, rigid rules, or perfect spacing in the cottage garden. Instead, the form is organic and purposefully unstructured. Plants self-sow here and there, bulbs pop up and spread unrestricted, and everything appears casual; though as you'll come to learn through Dalby's words, it is all done with great intent. Overflowing with textures and colors, the cottage gardens featured throughout this book in hundreds of full-color photographs are found in places as diverse as Germany, Sweden, Denmark, England, and the United States. The accompanying text is derived from Dalby's personal visits to these gardens, along with his intimate interviews with the resident gardeners. Dalby provides useful details about the design, development, and continued evolution of cottage gardens. He shares the stories of these breathtaking modern cottage gardens in a way that allows you to glean inspiration you can use to create a cottage garden of your own, whether large or small.  The gardens profiled in these pages exhibit the essential foundational elements and principals of well-designed cottage gardens. Whether home is in the countryside or a suburban subdivision, the profiled gardens will serve as both muse and motivation for the creation of a classic backyard cottage garden in your own space. This gorgeous tome is sure to become the bible of this much-adored classic garden design style.Also by Claus Dalby:Containers in the Garden</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/115545428-the-cottage-garden?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=Gqg8DjuxFo&amp;rank=1","rating_average":4.56,"rating_count":95,"review_count":36,"created":"2025-04-04T20:46:45+00:00","developers":"Claus Dalby"},

On their backs they bore a legendary treasure-hoard: coffers spilling over with blazing gems, strongboxes bright with gold, and the jeweled idols of a thousand gods. They were never seen again.</p><p>Today the gleaming domes at the top of the world have fallen to the passage of time and the crush of glaciers. Once-imperious halls are coated with dust and ice; memories of the fabled treasure hoard - and the heretical Theophages - are lost to antiquity.</p><p>But deep within the heart of the mountain, the flames of Chaos sputter and flare.</p><p>Now the legacy of the God Eaters is drawing to a close. With each thunderous turn of the Alembic Key, meteors streak the sky and prophets fling themselves from the turrets of high towers. In the alleys and the palaces, all know that the hour of the dragon will soon be at hand. Can you and your companions master the mysteries of the God Eaters in time? Or - like so many others before - will you succumb to the Music of the Spheres?</p><p>The boxed set is bursting with the puzzles, foes, and magic only found in a DCC RPG adventure. Inside you will find the God Eaters' grand alchymical experiment, with its spinning alembic and rotating elemental spheres. This takes the form of a large game board, approximately 17\"\" x 22\"\", with four separate spinning maps that attach to the board. An adventure booklet of 112 pages provides hitherto unknown monsters, perils, and traps. These lurk in the forgotten corridors, certain to bring a quick end to overconfident explorers.</p><p>Players will have the opportunity to study and manipulate the fabled Alembic Key, a relic rife with Theophagic sigils and zodiac signs. But beware, foolhardy reavers! Rotating the key spins the dungeon, transforming the PCs and altering reality itself! Left in the hands of a fidgety player, it could easily spell the end of the multiverse. This physical prop is composed of two spinning dials and is used by players during the adventure.</p><p>And as befitting DCC #100, the adventure is replete with player handouts in the form of a 28-page booklet containing over 40 illustrations of the Alembic, its elemental spheres, and the terrors lurking within the dark halls, as well as the infamous Sheaves of Chaos.</p><p>Finally, any adventure is only as good as the judge running it. Music of the Spheres is Chaos was designed with the judge in mind. The boxed set includes the Bookmark of 4 Parts - a tool for referencing the PCs' own changes.</p><p>This Boxed Set includes:</p><p>- Adventure Booklet (112 pages)</p><p>- Player Handout Booklet (28 pages and more than 40 illustrations)</p><p>- Large 17\" x 22\" Gameboard and four separate Spinning Maps</p><p>- Double-sided bookmark of 4 Parts (to track changes imposed by the Spinning Map)</p><p>- Alembic Key prop (used by players to spin the dungeon!)</p><p>- 3 Sheaves of Chaos handouts</p><p>With its many unique components, Music of the Spheres is Chaos captures all the magic and wonder that you've come to expect from a DCC RPG adventure. But fans familiar with Harley Stroh's work in Legacy of the Savage Kings, Sailors on the Starless Sea, and his many other adventures will know that our adventures are always far more than the sum of their parts.</p><p>You won't mistake this dungeon for any other adventure, anywhere, ever.</p><p>Be sure to check out our complete coverage of DCC #100 The Music of the Spheres is Chaos on www.goodman-games.com!

From Here to There presents nine all-new adventures focused on traveling from point A to point B. Sure, your players may be going from one dungeon to another - but why not spice up things in between? From aerial assaults to haunted bridges, From Here to There turns \"getting there\" into a lot more fun! Covering levels 2 to 13, this compilation has a place in every campaign.</p><p>This adventure compilation includes the following great adventures:</p><p>- The Quick and the Dead (level 12), by Aeryn Rudel: While en route to their next adventure, the PCs pass through a thick copse of trees and are ambushed by a group of quickling muggers. The quicklings, however, do not attack to kill; instead, the little fey attempt to snatch a valuable item from each PC and then race off into the forest!</p><p>- When Madness Seeps Through (level 5), by Philippe-Antoine \"\"ChattyDM\"\" Menard: While traveling from a nearby town to their destination, the PCs spot a group of aberrant humanoids running across the road, each clutching struggling humans who call for help. Chasing the humanoids or following their trail deeper in the forest, the PCs find a forgotten temple occupied by the corrupted remnants of cultists.</p><p>- The Deadly Blue Yonder (level 13), by Brandes Stoddard: A group of evil cultists discovered a nest of wyvern eggs, and when those eggs hatched the cultists trained the wyverns as mounts. They have used this remarkable advantage to establish a dominion over the local countryside. As the PCs pass through their territory, they must defend themselves against aerial attack!</p><p>- The Toll Station (level 6), by Adrian Pommier: While passing through a toll station, the PCs are beset by nightmare creatures pulled from the imprisoned minds of the road wardens. To awaken the sleeping guardsmen and end the attacks, the PCs must smash a profane idol and defeat a demon of the Nightmare Goddess!</p><p>- The Crossing (level 4), by Chris Dias: The PCs are traveling near a river or through mountainous terrain when they find themselves in a thick fog. As they venture further, they come to a bridge. With no sign of alternate routes, they must make their way across. The bridge is an illusion generated by a predatory monster called a chosis mimic - a psychic creature that feeds on the life spirit of those traveling near it. The illusionary bridge has no beginning and no end, and no matter how long the PCs travel, they never reach its end before they reach theirs - unless they destroy the chosis mimic!</p><p>- The Hanging Tree (level 5), by Lee Hammock: The village of Tarrow has been using a local hanging tree to execute criminals for centuries, but now an innocent man has been added to its roster of the dead. The spirits of those previously killed on the tree have now risen up in a quest for vengeance, making travel through the area very difficult. After escaping from the undead raised by the hanging tree, the players reach Tarrow and discover why the spirits of the tree are restless by talking to the locals.</p><p>- Flying High (level 2), by Colleen Simpson: The PCs are en route to their next adventure, traveling through a lightly wooded hilly area, when they are swooped upon by steelwing hippogriffs, which attempt to carry one or more PCs to their nest site. When the PCs arrive at the nest area, they observe kobolds attacking the steelwing hippogriff nests. The steelwing hippogriffs need the assistance of the heroes!</p><p>- Mystery at the Wandering Wineskin Inn (level 5), by Ken McCutchen: The adventurers are resting comfortably at an inn. When the sun rises on a new day, the characters discover that one of the party members is missing! There are several items out of place in the room, and a search reveals several interesting clues. To locate the missing character, the party must gain knowledge about the missing companion, overcome misdirection from false allies, and defeat the brigands who are holding the missing character for ransom.</p><p>- The Hunting Party (level 2), by Brandes Stoddard: In the wilds, the PCs encounter a large group of goblins. The normally aggressive creatures recognize that the PCs carry their weapons with experience and skill, and they are reluctant to engage a foe who could cost them many of their own hunters and foragers. They even go so far as to buy off the PCs with a side of boar meat or venison from a recent kill.</p><p>Rules Set: 4E</p><p>Developer: Harley Stroh</p><p>Writers: Chris Dias, Lee Hammock, Phillippe-Antoine Menard, Ken McCutcheon, Adrian Pommier, Aeryn Rudel, Colleen Simpson, Brandes Stoddard, Harley Stroh</p><p>Cover Artist: David Griffith</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42972032-the-map-from-here-to-there?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=rlLj3MpJYU&amp;rank=1","rating_average":3.68,"rating_count":3265,"review_count":549,"created":"2025-03-22T22:09:20+00:00","developers":"Chris Dias, Lee Hammock, Phillippe-Antoine Menard, Ken McCutcheon, Adrian Pommier, Aeryn Rudel, Colleen Simpson, Brandes Stoddard, and Harley Stroh"},

Then it's time to say goodbye to your standard grass lawn and join the Groundcover Revolution!  Turns out you're not alone in your desire to ditch the lawn and replace it with something prettier, more diverse, lower maintenance, welcoming to pollinators, and good for Earth's climate health. Reducing the lawn is among the biggest trends in homeownership, with an endless stream of homeowners looking for an eco-friendly alternative to a traditional turfgrass lawn. In the last few years alone, over 23 million American adults converted part of their lawn to a natural landscape, and now they're looking to do even more.  The biggest challenge to adopting this new ideal of the perfect lawn? Knowing how and when to replace your turf, and which plants are the best ones for the job. Groundcover Revolution is here with all the answers you need (and some you didn't even know you needed!).  Those answers include: • How replacing a lawn with groundcovers reduces resource consumption on a significant level • Why groundcovers require far less long-term maintenance than turf after establishment • The many additional benefits of groundcovers, including erosion control, a reduction in chemical usage, a boost in biodiversity, and mitigation of climate change as a carbon sink • The ways groundcovers overcome challenges such as tree roots, compacted soils, poor drainage, and dense shade • The step-by-step mechanics of how to get rid of your lawn, how to place and plant groundcovers from seeds, plugs, or transplants, and how to care for your new \"quilted lawn\" once it's in place   Also included are 40 in-depth profiles of plants that are perfect choices for replacing a grass lawn. There are options for sun, for shade, for dry and wet sites, and for various climates around the globe. There are choices that bloom, options that are evergreen, and selections that are deer resistant. Author Kathy Jentz has also included an incredibly useful chart that gives youall the specifics on each of the 40 choices for quick reference and to make your groundcover selection process even easier.  Don't let a lack of information stop you from creating the no-mow groundcover lawn of your dreams. Join the revolution and say goodbye to the burden of lawn care and hello to summer weekends relaxing by the pool or camping with family and friends. Whether you want to replace the entire lawn or just reduce the amount of land dedicated to turf, it's time to usher in a new and improved idea of what a beautiful lawn should be.</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61360110-groundcover-revolution?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=pFYTCiSoAp&amp;rank=1","rating_average":3.85,"rating_count":52,"review_count":23,"created":"2025-04-04T20:46:45+00:00","developers":"Kathy Jentz"},

That's the battle cry of millions of modern gardeners who are not only looking to reduce the amount of time and energy they have to spend tending a lawn, but they're also looking to improve the lives of their family, friends, and neighbors by supplying them with fresh, homegrown food. In the United States alone, 46 million acres of land are covered in turfgrass (that's more acreage than corn and soybeans combined!). Imagine all the good that would come if that land were dedicated to growing food instead! Converting unused areas of the landscape into food gardens helps mitigate the effects of climate change, reduces food miles, improves food security, and allows us to be a better steward of our little slice of the planet. But how do you get started? Which plants do you choose? Is there a series of best practices to follow to successfully convert your yard into an edible oasis so that it's not just high-yielding, but it's also attractive? Growing an Edible Landscape is here to help answer all of these questions and many more.Setting up an edible landscape is much more than just placing a few tomato-filled raised beds in the middle of the lawn, though for some gardeners, this might be a logical place to start. The eventual goal, however, is to have a landscape filled with layers of fruitful plants combined together to produce edible harvests for as many months of the year as possible. To reach that end, there's much to plan and do to ensure your success. Authors Gary Pilarchik of @therustedgarden and Dr. Chiara D'Amore have devised the perfect guidebook to take you from \"turfgrass overwhelm\" to consistent harvests of a huge diversity of homegrown edible plants. And the best part is—you can create an edible paradise whether your yard is large or small, sunny or shaded, urban or rural, or level or sloped.  A few highlights of the systems and techniques outlined in these pages include:    • The phases of the transformation process and how they are different for everyone • Real-world, sensible garden design options for edible yards  •Step-by-step projects to get growing today • How to choose the edible plants that are best for your conditions  •Practical plant-care tips for everything from seed starting to fertilizing and watering • Pick-and-choose menus to help you combine productive plants in an attractive way  • Ways in which your edible landscape can cultivate community   Also included are 25 profiles of common and uncommon plants for an edible yard. From raspberries and asparagus to fruit trees and dandelions, these food plants are great additions to any edible landscape plan. Start small or go big—it's your choice! By saying goodbye to lawn and hello to an edible landscape, you'll soon be starting on a deeply personal journey toward a more self-sufficient and flavorful life.</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123204415-growing-an-edible-landscape?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=NEAT2YleHb&amp;rank=1","rating_average":4.09,"rating_count":44,"review_count":10,"created":"2025-04-04T20:46:45+00:00","developers":"Chiara D'Amore"},

With most people, repression of emotions can lead to stress or even illness ó mental, physical, or both. With some, however, those emotions run deep and hold great power. How does the repressed emotion of a powerful sorcerer manifest itself? What of a young person with the undeveloped potential to be a summoner? Or what if a relatively normal person just dams up a reservoir of repressed emotion, only to have a triggering incident ignite it into life like a tindertwig tossed in a vat of lamp oil? In rare cases, these powerful emotions manifest, arising from a person to take on a life of their own. These are the ikiryo, the living spirits. Guided by the subconscious desires of its progenitor, an ikiryo acts where the person does not, free of its creatorís inhibitions, morals, and reservations. This powerful emotional force is a danger to all it encounters, especially the focus or cause of those emotions, and potentially deadly to those with which it interacts.</p>","content_type":"ebook","url":"https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Lost%20Lore%20Ikiryo%20The%20Living%20Spirits%20(PF)","rating_average":null,"rating_count":null,"review_count":null,"created":"2025-03-22T22:04:48+00:00","developers":""},

In New Naturalism, horticulturist and modern plantsman Kelly D. Norris shares his inspiring, ecologically sound vision for home gardens created with stylish yet naturalistic plantings that mimic the wild spaces we covet—far from the contrived, formal, high-maintenance plantings of the past. Through a basic introduction to plant biology and ecology, you'll learn how to design and grow a lush, thriving home garden by harnessing the power of plant layers and palettes defined by nature, not humans.The next generation of home landscapes don't consist of plants in a row, pruned to perfection and reliant on pesticides, fertilizers, and herbicides to survive. Instead, today's stunning landscapes convey nature's inherent beauty. These gardens are imbued with romance and emotion, yet they have so much more to offer than their gorgeous aesthetics. Naturalistic garden designs, such as those featured in this groundbreaking new book, contribute to positive environmental change by increasing biodiversity, providing a refuge for wildlife, and reconnecting humans to nature. In the pages of New Naturalism you'll find: •Planting recipes for building meadows, prairies, and other grassland-inspired open plantings even in compact, urban settings•Nature-inspired ways to upgrade existing foundation plantings, shrub beds, and flower borders to a wilder aesthetic while still managing the space•Inspiration for taking sidewalk and driveway plantings and turning them into visually soft, welcoming spaces for humans and wildlife alike•Ideas for turning shady landscapes into canopied retreats that celebrate nature •Creative ways to make an ecologically vibrant garden in even the smallest of spacesNew Naturalism approaches the planting beds around our homes as ecological systems. If properly designed and planted, these areas can support positive environmental change, increase plant and animal diversity, and create a more resilient space that's less reliant on artificial inputs.

At their beck and call are the support units of armored vehicles, power armored infantry, aerospace fighters and more, wielded by a MechWarrior's skillful command to aid him in ultimate victory.

For the first time, all the rules for various units that have a direct impact on the deadly battlefields of the thirty-first century appear in a unified rules set: from BattleMechs to ProtoMechs, Combat Vehicles to Support Vehicles, infantry to aerospace fighters and DropShips.

The underdark is far more than just dungeons and caves. It is a veritable underground continent, populated by advanced civilizations, ancient ruins, sunless seas, alien magic, bizarre creatures, and the horrid denizens of the gloom. The standards of the surface world hold no sway in the underdark, and its mysteries, ferocity, and danger will challenge even the hardiest of adventurers.</p><p>This book includes everything you need to create a compelling underdark world. Underdark adventures are easy to integrate with an existing campaign, as the very nature of the underdark lends itself to layering - simply arrange for the discovery of a subterranean portal, and the land beneath your existing campaign has a new life.</p><p>The Underdark Adventure Guide is divided into four chapters:</p><p>- The first chapter examines the characters of the underdark, especially among the most populous races: the drow, duergar, derro, svirfneblin, and troglodytes. This section defines the most renowned traits of these races with a variety of new prestige classes, then concludes with new equipment, feats, and skill applications useful to everyone. You can use this section to flesh out the enemies your PCs will face, or apply them to the stats for these underdark races found in the MM and DMG to use them as player characters.</p><p>- Chapter two introduces a variety of new monsters suitable to life in the underdark.</p><p>- Chapter three provides guidelines for creating an underdark campaign. These are mostly for inspiration - a collection of keywords and ideas that can help you get started on a new campaign, or tie together elements of an existing one.</p><p>- The book concludes with chapter four, which describes several points of interest in great detail. These cities, camps, and other locations can be dropped into your own campaign as needed, or inserted in their totality as an already-defined area.</p><p>The Underdark Adventure Guide is a stand-alone book. It can be used in conjunction with the Aerial Adventure Guide, or used independently. If you're planning an underdark campaign, you might also be interested in Monsters of the Endless Dark, Complete Guide to Drow, and Complete Guide to Beholders.</p><p>Rules Set: D&amp;D 3</p><p>Writers: Michael Mearls and Dean Poisso</p><p>Cover Artist: V.
